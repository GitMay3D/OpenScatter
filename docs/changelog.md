# Changelog

**02/03/2025** 

- Added a fix for the errors that happen when you're working in multiple scenes. However it's a semi-experimental feature since you have to manually update the visibility of scatter systems when you switch between scenes. I added a refresh button next to the system list that lets you do that. I plan on making it update the visibility automatically in a future release.
- Added a "Proxy Object" choice in the optimized mesh menu. This allows you to select a low-poly mesh to display. There are currently low-poly meshes for things like trees, grass, rocks, etc.  
- Added an option to hide specific scatter systems in the viewport and render. 
- Changed the icon for entering weight paint mode to reflect the weight paint mode accurately.

> **Note**: Working with multiple scenes is semi-experimental. It should work in most cases, but may still have some bugs or limitations. Do it with caution and let me know if you run into any issues!
