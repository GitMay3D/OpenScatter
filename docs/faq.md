## General

**Q:** Is OpenScatter really free?

**Q:**Which Blender versions are supported?

## Features & Workflow

**Q:** What are "scatter systems"?

**A:** Scatter systems is the core of OpenScatter. You can think of each scatter system as it's own layer. For example, you can have one layer (scatter sytem) for grass, one for rocks, and one for clover. This allows you to keep everything organized and non-destructive.

**Q:** What is an "Emitter Object"?

**A:** An emitter object stores all the info and settings for your scatter systems. When you use the addon, you pick an emitter object, then you add and adjust scatter systems for that emitter object. To add scatter systems to another emitter, just use the object picker at the top of the panel to select a new emitter object. All scatter systems will be stored and linked to the appropriate emitter objects.
